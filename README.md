The Heart Disease Prediction Website is a web-based platform designed to help users assess their risk of developing heart-related conditions using machine learning models.
<hr>
This project is a web application designed to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical and personal attributes. It leverages machine learning to provide a quick, data-driven analysis that can be used for informational purposes.

Technologies Used ðŸ’»
Frontend:

HTML: For the structure of the web pages.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript: For client-side form validation and interactive elements.

Backend:

Python: The core programming language for the server-side logic.

Flask: A micro web framework used to handle HTTP requests, serve the HTML pages, and connect the front-end with the machine learning model.

Machine Learning:

Scikit-learn: A powerful Python library used for building and training the heart disease prediction model.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for preparing the input data before feeding it to the model.

Pickle: The model is saved as a .pkl file using this library, allowing the Flask application to load the trained model and make predictions without retraining it every time
